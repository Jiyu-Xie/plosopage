	<br/> 
	Iron -sulfur protein s are proteins characterized by the presence of iron-sulfur clusters containing sulfide-linked di-, tri-, and tetra iron centers in variable oxidation states.Iron-sulfur clusters play an important role in the oxidation-reduction reactions of mitochondrial electron transport. They have many other functions including catalysis as illustrated by aconitase The prevalence of these proteins on the metabolic pathways of most organisms leads some scientists to theorize that iron-sulfur compounds had a significant role in the origin of life in the iron-sulfur world theory.Recently, Dr.XieCan at School of Life Sciences, Peking University and his collaborators discovered a novel magnetoreceptor protein (named MagR)and suggested a biocompass model for animal magnetoreception and navigation.This article will give a brief introduction to the iron -sulfur protein’s structural motifs, biosynthesis and latest research of iron -sulfur protein in magnetic protein biocompass.

	<br/>
	Sighing, one of the most common human emotions, is usually associated with sadness, disappointment, rejection, giving up and other negative emotions, but why people sigh is rarely studied. The act of sighing was first studied in more detail by Karl-Halvor Teigen, a psychologist at the university of Oslo in Norway. In this paper, Teigen's research on sigh behavior is discussed and its physiological principles and limitations are briefly analyzed. The study of sigh behavior helps to bring the interrelationship between perception, consciousness and behavior into a new perspective.

	<br/> 
	The most common way to cool hot components today is by using big stock coolers with air flow, provided by the stock fans that come with the CPU and GPU.It is necessary to understand how heat transfer across the CPU first. Heat transfer across the CPU mainly has three types. Firstly, conduction, which happens in direct metal-to-metal contact. Secondly, convection, which happens in liquids and gases where hot air in a large room rises, or cold water sinks. And thirdly, radiation.

	<br/> 
	Graphene is a flat film composed of carbon atoms in a hexagonal honeycomb lattice. In 2004, the British physicist at the university of Manchester, Geim and Novoselov successfully using graphite from micro mechanical stripping method and obtained the stability of single-layer graphene, which broke the two-dimensional crystal can't stability theory predicts that proved that graphene can exist alone, both of them and therefore won the Nobel Prize in physics in 2010, thus raised the graphene preparation, modification and application of the global boom. Commercial production of large areas of high-quality graphene is the basic premise for its promotion in industrial applications. Therefore, in order to adapt to the wide potential application of graphene and its requirements for the production of high-quality graphene, scientists need to control the nucleation and growth of graphene grains to obtain large sheets of single-crystal graphene. This paper starts with a brief description of the structure of graphene, mainly introduces the research and preparation methods of monocrystalline graphene, and finally prospects the future application of graphene.

	With the development of The Times, the achievements in various fields of science and technology have gradually penetrated into People's Daily life. As one of the representatives, uav industry has become the fastest growing consumer electronics industry except mobile phones, computers and wearable devices. An increasing number of ordinary consumers also have more opportunities to reach areas previously inaccessible by normal channels through drones. Therefore, how to effectively catch illegal drones, in order to prevent and reduce the public security impact caused by illegal drones, has become an important topic, we need an effective system and corresponding capture equipment to achieve this goal.

	<br/> 
	Research has shown that the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) released into the atmosphere has increased significantly since the beginning of the industrial era. Unless we do something to reduce the amount of CO2 entering the atmosphere, the world will experience serious effects of climate change, leading climate catastrophe to the earth, and may change earth to a place where human beings are no longer able to survive. In this case, Oceanic Carbon Capture and Sequestration (OCCS) might be one of the best emergency strategies in dealing with climate change and global warming due to the large capacity of storing CO2, despite its non-ignorable disadvantages and highly-concerned potential risks(e.g. high financial costs, poptential negative environmental, ecological, geological impacts, etc. ). And by then, it is inevitable for the governments and publics to accept such OCCS strategies, in order to survive.

	<br/> 
	Microrobotics and nanorobotics have the potential to perform many tasks in important biomedical applications. These micro/nano-machines are capable of propulsion at low Reynolds number fluidic environments by an external rotating magnetic field. For decades, roboticists have focused their efforts on rigid systems that enable programmable, automated action, and sophisticated control with maximal precision and speed. Meanwhile, it is also critical to develop new soft and flexible architectures and potential modes that are small, soft, adaptive, and stimuli-responsive, for the structure and kinetic optimization. In this report, by combing the concepts from micro/nano-robotics and stimuli-responsive shape-shifting materials, scientists designed some ‘smart’ robotics known as Origami Inspired Soft Micro/Nano-robotics, with its potential fabrication and control methods. This origami inspired soft small scale magnetic robots are capable of efficient propulsion at low Reynolds numbers and cargo delivery. This new micro/nano-robotics mechanism and its attractive performance could provide guidance toward prospective practical design for biomedical operation at the micro/nano-scale.

	<br/> 
	Evaporation and cooling are processes with tremendous industrial and scientific applications, ranging from meteorology to food processing. These problem would be of special interest to food and drink companies, such as Starbucks, who would like to figure out the best cup design to improve the customer experiences with the lowest cost; or inspired us design new type of self-filling bottle for the people in the arid area. If wildly being used, the device could contribute to the happiness of millions of hot beverage consumers and help billions of people who lack of drinking water. The present work investigated the thermodynamic properties of moist air around a cup of hot water, which was placed in each of the cups in the same amounts and left on a counter to cool. Temperature, humidity data were taken over the course of twenty minutes while they were cooling, with data points taken every ten seconds. Experimental data and simulation model suggests that the temperature is highest in the shadow zone of the cup, and therefore, the relative humidity becomes very low.
